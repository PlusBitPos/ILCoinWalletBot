# **The ILCoin Wallet Bot is live on Telegram!** 

The ILCoin Wallet Bot is a payment processor built specifically for Telegram so ILCitizens can quickly and easily send each other **ILCoin** **$ILC** for being helpful, being friendly, or for goods and services. 

Every tx takes place instantly and on-chain. We're launching the ILCoinWalletBot now in all of our Telegram chatrooms so please DM the bot (http://t.me/ILCoinWalletBot) to register with it, learn its commands, and start spreading $ILC around to your deserving friends and strangers in the community. 

If you aren't already on Telegram then find the main room of the ILCitizens on any platform at https://t.me/ILCoinDevelopmentTeam and join us there now!

The bot is live in telegram, you can contact it @ILCoinWalletBot, you can add it to your group, or message it directly.

**How to get an address**
First you need to create a wallet, the way to do this is to start a private conversation with the bot and “/start”. If you already did this before, you can issue “/deposit” to make the bot give you your deposit address again. 

**Tipping someone**
Send the command like this;
 /tip (username) (amount)
example:
 /tip @Fahim_BTX 10

**Checking your balance**
You can check your balance in one of ILCoin’s blockchain explorers or asking the bot to show you your /balance

**Withdraw funds**
You can send any amount of ILC (provided your balance covers the amount and the fee) to any public address. Send a message like this:
/withdraw (your wallet address) (amount)
example:
/withdraw 19rMDYWmGv4PNiF12xL3exkKG23WGMxCwf 5
